- ## Parcine

    - [x] parce first element
    - [x] parce map

- ## Ray_cast
    - [x] draw a simple map
    - [x] make player move
    - [x] put one ray
    - [x] make ray rotate
    - [x] determine the direction `<` `^` `>` and `v`
    ***
    - [x] determine the coordinates `there is thre steps`
        - [x] `1` det coordinates that is represent a wall at the intersictions with __x__
        - [x] `2` det coordinates that is represent a wall at the intersictions with __y__
            - in the two steps above we should write a function that calculate the coord `(x,y)`
                and other one that check if you can  move to this coordinates
        - [x] `3` choos the coordinates that have a ray __R__ less than other
    - [x] make the ray stop if there are a wall in the next position

        cos(o) = x/R           &&             sin(o) = y/R


        tan(o) = sin(o)/cos(o)      =>        tan(o) = y/x


        x = y/tan(o)           &&             y = tan(o)*x



***
- ## Draw Walls
    - [x] darwing walls
    - [x] draw walls with texturs
